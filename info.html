            <article>
                <p>Peakbase let's you do three things:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Register which peaks you have ascended.</li>
                    <li>Visualize the peaks you haven't been to.</li>
                    <li>Register the dates of your ascents.</li>
                </ul>


                <h2 id="usage">General concept</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Upload your peakbase-file, or a gpx-file containing
                        locations of peaks (skip this step if you are
                        starting from scratch).</li>
                    <li>Add peaks and ascents.</li>
                    <li>Download your peakbase-file after you are finished
                        editing.</li>
                    <li>Start from the top the next time you want to register
                        new peaks and ascents.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Peakbase is designed to avoid the need for a user account
                and a backend server. Instead of logging in, you just upload
                your peakbase-file, and when you are done, you just download
                the updated version of the file.</p>

                <h3>Detailed usage</h3>
                <h4>Map legend</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Red markers: Peaks not visited.</li>
                    <li>Blue markers: Peaks visitied.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Add peaks to your peakbase-file</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Double click on map to add a point.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Enter name and elevation of point.</li>
                            <li>Click "Save" to save peak.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Register peak as visited</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Click on red markers (unvisited peaks) and confirm to
                        mark them as visited. This will turn the marker blue.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Register ascent with date</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>After you have registered a peak as visited, you may
                        also register the dates of your ascent(s). Do this by
                        clicking the blue marker, and enter the date in the
                        menu to the right.</li>

                </ul>
                <h4>Download your peakbase-file</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you are done with registering peaks, download your
                    peakbase-file as .gpx or .json with the buttons in the top
                    right corner beside the map.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Only the JSON-version of the peakbase-file will contain the
                            dates of your ascents. The gpx-file only contains the peaks
                            and whether they are visited or not.</li>
                        <li>The downloaded file has a timestamp in the filename, in
                            order to easily see when you last updated the
                            peakbase.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <h4>General tips</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>While JSON is the preferred format for Peakbase (since
                    this is more flexible, and allows storing for example
                    ascent dates), the tool also accepts GPX-files. This is
                    useful, since you can import files downloaded from for
                    example <a href="https://peakbook.org">peakbook.org</a>.
                    GPX-files can also be easily plotted in a range of other online
                and offline software tools, so it might be useful to keep both a
                GPX- and a JSON-version of your peakbase.</li>

                </ul>

                <h2 id="about">About</h2>

                <p>Peakbase is a minimalistic tool for peak baggers (those who
                collect ascents of peaks). The functionality consists of:

                <ul>
                    <li>Collect and visualize peaks you have not visited yet.</li>
                    <li>Collect and visualize peaks you have visited.</li>
                    <li>Register how many times you have visited a peak, and on
                        which dates.</li>
                </ul>

                The tool is designed with the following things in mind:

                <ul>
                    <li><b>You control your own data, and everything the tool does
                        happens locally in your browser (except loading the
                        background map).</b> This means that you don't have to
                    create a user account, or keep your personal data on anyone
                    elses server. It also means that you can download this tool and
                    keep it stored offline, and it will be usable forever, totally
                    independent of whether the developer of Peakbase keeps the tool
                    online or not.</li>
                </ul>

                Other things to keep in mind:

                <ul>
                    <li>Peakbase can also be used to register other points of
                        interest as well. Example of locations to collect:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Camp sites</li>
                            <li>Bouldering sites</li>
                            <li>Geocaches</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
