                <h2 id="what">What is Peakbase?</h2>

                <p>Peakbase makes it easy to collect peaks, and visualize the ones you haven't yet ascended. With Peakbase, you can also register the dates of your ascents.</p>


                <h2 id="how">How do I use it?</h2>

                <p>To start using Peakbase, you have three options:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Use the default peakbase</strong>): Click "Start new peakbase", which loads a ready-to-use peakbase with over 38 000 peaks in Norway already registered.</li>
                    <li><strong>Start from scratch</strong>: Double-click on locations in the map to register new peaks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Upload an existing file with locations</strong>: This could be a GPX-file created using another tool, or your existing peakbase.</li>
                    <!-- <li>Double-click on locations in the map to register new peaks, and click on the newly registered peaks (red markers) to mark them as ascended.</li> -->
                </ol>

                <p>Whether you use the pre-existing peakbase (option 1) or start building your own from scratch (option 2), the registered peaks will appear as red markers in the map. To mark peaks as ascended/visited, click on them and confirm, and the markers will turn blue, indicating that you have "bagged" that peak.</p>

                <!-- <ol> -->
                <!--     <li>Upload your peakbase-file, or a gpx-file containing -->
                <!--         locations of peaks (skip this step if you are -->
                <!--         starting from scratch).</li> -->
                <!--     <li>Add peaks and ascents.</li> -->
                <!--     <li>Download your peakbase-file after you are finished -->
                <!--         editing.</li> -->
                <!--     <li>Start from the top the next time you want to register -->
                <!--         new peaks and ascents.</li> -->
                <!-- </ol> -->

                <h3>Detailed usage</h3>
                <h4>Map legend</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Red markers: Peaks not visited.</li>
                    <li>Blue markers: Peaks visitied.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Add peaks to your peakbase-file</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Double click on map to add a point.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Enter name and elevation of point.</li>
                            <li>Click "Save" to save peak.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Register peak as visited</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Click on red markers (unvisited peaks) and confirm to
                        mark them as visited. This will turn the marker blue.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Register ascent with date</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>After you have registered a peak as visited, you may
                        also register the dates of your ascent(s). Do this by
                        clicking the blue marker, and enter the date in the
                        menu to the right.</li>

                </ul>
                <h4>Download your peakbase-file</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you are done with registering peaks, download your
                    peakbase-file as .gpx or .json with the buttons in the top
                    right corner beside the map.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Only the JSON-version of the peakbase-file will contain the
                            dates of your ascents. The gpx-file only contains the peaks
                            and whether they are visited or not.</li>
                        <li>The downloaded file has a timestamp in the filename, in
                            order to easily see when you last updated the
                            peakbase.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <h4>General tips</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>While JSON is the preferred format for Peakbase (since
                    this is more flexible, and allows storing for example
                    ascent dates), the tool also accepts GPX-files. This is
                    useful, since you can import files downloaded from for
                    example <a href="https://peakbook.org">peakbook.org</a>.
                    GPX-files can also be easily plotted in a range of other online
                and offline software tools, so it might be useful to keep both a
                GPX- and a JSON-version of your peakbase.</li>

                </ul>

                <h2 id="why">Why should I use it?</h2>

                <p>Peakbase is designed to avoid the need for yet another user account. Instead of logging in, you upload your peakbase, and when you are done, you just download the updated version of the file. Store your peakbase wherever you like!</p>

                <h2 id="about">About</h2>

                <p>Peakbase is a minimalistic tool for peak baggers (those who
                collect ascents of peaks). The functionality consists of:

                <ul>
                    <li>Register and visualize peaks you have not visited yet.</li>
                    <li>Register and visualize peaks you have visited.</li>
                    <li>Register how many times and when you have visited a peak.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The tool is designed to <em>do one thing, and do it well</em>, and with privacy in mind. <b>You control your own data, and everything the tool does happens locally in your browser</b>, except loading the background map. This means that you don't have to create a user account, or share your data with anoyone else. It also means that you can download this tool and keep it stored offline, and it will be usable forever, totally independent of whether the developer of Peakbase keeps the tool online or not.</p>

                <p>Peakbase can also be used to register other points of interest as well. Example of locations to collect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Camp sites</li>
                    <li>Fishing spots</li>
                    <li>Bouldering sites</li>
                    <li>Geocaches</li>
                </ul>
