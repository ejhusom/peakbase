                <h4>Add peaks to your peakbase-file</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Double click on map to add a point.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Enter name and elevation of point.</li>
                            <li>Click "Save" to save peak.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Register peak as visited</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Click on red markers (unvisited peaks) and confirm to
                        mark them as visited. This will turn the marker blue.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Register ascent with date</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>After you have registered a peak as visited, you may
                        also register the dates of your ascent(s). Do this by
                        clicking the blue marker, and enter the date in the
                        menu to the right.</li>

                </ul>
                <h4>Download your peakbase-file</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you are done with registering peaks, download your
                    peakbase-file as .gpx or .json with the buttons in the top
                    right corner beside the map.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Only the JSON-version of the peakbase-file will contain the
                            dates of your ascents. The gpx-file only contains the peaks
                            and whether they are visited or not.</li>
                        <li>The downloaded file has a timestamp in the filename, in
                            order to easily see when you last updated the
                            peakbase.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <h4>General tips</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>While JSON is the preferred format for Peakbase (since
                    this is more flexible, and allows storing for example
                    ascent dates), the tool also accepts GPX-files. This is
                    useful, since you can import files downloaded from for
                    example <a href="https://peakbook.org">peakbook.org</a>.
                    GPX-files can also be easily plotted in a range of other online
                and offline software tools, so it might be useful to keep both a
                GPX- and a JSON-version of your peakbase.</li>
                </ul>
